Hi there!üëã

My name is Ben Thornton and I am a mechanical engineer with expertise in MSC Adams and Python. I have a passion for customizing and automating engineering simulations, and I offer a range of consulting services to help clients streamline and optimize their workflows.

Here are some of the services I offer:

* **Simulation projects**: I gather necessary data from clients and build an Adams model to analyze and report on the results.
* **Customization and process automation**: I write Adams plugins to automate clients' simulation workflows.
* **Workflow development and refinement**: I can help clients develop or refine their simulation methodology.

In addition to my consulting services, I also make some of my work available on GitHub as open-source libraries and Adams plugins. I believe in sharing knowledge and expertise, and I hope that my open-source contributions can benefit others in the engineering community.

I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to apply my skills and experience, and I would love to connect with other engineers and discuss potential projects or collaborations. Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile!

## :man_technologist: Consulting Services
### Quick-start projects
I will help you install and configure MSC software products for your environment, and provide general instruction for your staff in using the 
software in your product development process.

### Knowledge transfer
I will perform simulations for you and then use the simulation as a basis for transferring the necessary 
knowledge to your staff. I do this through a step-by-step approach of training your team on the process I used to setup, simulate and 
post process your simulation. This ensures your teams are ready to successfully apply simulation to future design projects.

### Staff augmentation
I can become an extension of your team, and provide on-site resources to augment your current staff. 
I will work hand-in-hand with the team until the project is complete and
you are satisfied with the results.

### On-site support
On-site support can be a true life-saver when you are in a situation where it is imperative that an expert be available at your 
facility when needed for either a short period of time, or the entire length of a design project which can sometimes be weeks, 
months or even years.

### Simulation projects
If you only need to do analysis infrequently, I offer simulation projects and consulting to 
tackle your toughest problems. I will help you to understand your goals and your design problem first. 
Once I know what you are trying to accomplish, I will gather from you the necessary data such as CAD models, physical test 
data, and materials data, and then run your simulation for you.

### Customization and process automation
MSC Software products are highly customizable and extendable. Customization allows customers to create specialized applications 
for proprietary processes within MSC Software tools. This can include custom user interfaces, automated reports, standardized 
modelling and simulation techniques, and specialized algorithms. I can then help you deploy and manage these customizations 
across your entire enterprise.

### Methods development
I'll evaluate your simulation needs and work with your staff to determine how to use simulation 
software to efficiently simulate your problem. This may include establishing simplifying assumptions, customizing numerical algorithms and correlating models to test.
